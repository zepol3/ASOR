NAME
       kill - send a signal to a process

SYNOPSIS
       kill [options] <pid> [...]

DESCRIPTION
       The default signal for kill is TERM.  Use -l or -L to list available signals.  Particularly useful signals include HUP, INT, KILL, STOP, CONT, and 0.  Alternate sig‐
       nals may be specified in three ways: -9, -SIGKILL or -KILL.  Negative PID values may be used to choose whole process groups; see the PGID column in ps  command  out‐
       put.  A PID of -1 is special; it indicates all processes except the kill process itself and init.

OPTIONS
       <pid> [...]
              Send signal to every <pid> listed.

       -<signal>
       -s <signal>
       --signal <signal>
              Specify the signal to be sent.  The signal can be specified by using name or number.  The behavior of signals is explained in signal(7) manual page.

       -l, --list [signal]
              List signal names.  This option has optional argument, which will convert signal number to signal name, or other way round.

       -L, --table
              List signal names in a nice table.

       NOTES  Your shell (command line interpreter) may have a built-in kill command.  You may need to run the command described here as /bin/kill to solve the conflict.

EXAMPLES
       kill -9 -1
              Kill all processes you can kill.

       kill -l 11
              Translate number 11 into a signal name.

       kill -L
              List the available signal choices in a nice table.

       kill 123 543 2341 3453
              Send the default signal, SIGTERM, to all those processes.
